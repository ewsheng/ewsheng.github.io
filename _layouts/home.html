<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
  I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.isi.edu/about/bio/prem_natarajan" target="_blank">Dr. Prem Natarajan</a> and <a href="http://vnpeng.net/" target="_blank">Dr. Nanyun Peng</a> at the Information Sciences Institute. I am interested in better understanding how biases and toxicity manifest in natural language processing techniques and advancing ideas for more fair NLP. Specifically, my research has focused on biases in language generation and dialogue systems. I'm also generally interested in model interpretability and robustness.

<p>
  Prior to doing my Ph.D., I studied Computer Science and Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley and worked at an intelligent voice search start-up in San Francisco.
