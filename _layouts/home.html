<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
  I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, advised by <a href="https://www.isi.edu/about/bio/prem_natarajan" target="_blank">Dr. Prem Natarajan</a> and <a href="http://vnpeng.net/" target="_blank">Dr. Nanyun Peng</a> at the Information Sciences Institute. I am excited about better understanding how bias manifests in natural language processing techniques and advancing ideas for more fair NLP. Specifically, my recent research focuses on biases in language generation and dialogue systems. I'm also interested in model interpretability and robustness.

  Prior to entering the Ph.D. program at USC, I studied Computer Science and Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley and worked at an intelligent voice search start-up in San Francisco.
