<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
  I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, advised by <a href="https://www.isi.edu/about/bio/prem_natarajan" target="_blank">Dr. Prem Natarajan</a> and mentored by <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~npeng/" target="_blank">Dr. Nanyun Peng</a> at the Information Sciences Institute. I am excited about better understanding how bias manifests in natural language processing techniques and advancing ideas for more fair NLP. I have previously worked in the areas of information extraction, named entity recognition, and using scientific literature to facilitate learning.

  Prior to entering the Ph.D. program at USC, I studied Computer Science and Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley and worked at an intelligent voice search start-up in San Francisco.
